##  Description

This MATLAB script simulates the reflectivity spectrum of a 1D Distributed Bragg Reflector (DBR) on a glass substrate that supports **optical Tamm plasmon states** (TM polarization).  
It uses the transfer matrix method (TMM) and calculates the reflection from a multilayer stack composed of alternating SiOâ‚‚ and Taâ‚‚Oâ‚… layers. and at the

## Output

The simulation demonstrates the photonic bandgap of the DBR, which shows the range where this DBR acts as a perfect reflector. The second code shows the **existence of a Tamm plasmon resonance** â€” a narrow dip in reflectivity inside the photonic bandgap center at the normal incidence of the TM polarized light. Optical Tamm plasmon resonance(also known as Tamm plasmon-polaritons) are special optical surface states that occur at the interface between a metal and a photonic crystal (typically a Distributed Bragg Reflector, or DBR). They are the photonic analogs of electronic Tamm states, which exist at the surface of a truncated periodic potential in solid-state physics.
