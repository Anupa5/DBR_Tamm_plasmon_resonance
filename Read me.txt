##  Description

This MATLAB script simulates the reflectivity spectrum of a one-dimensional Distributed Bragg Reflector (DBR) on a glass substrate that supports optical Tamm plasmon states under TM polarization. Optical Tamm plasmonics is a relatively new and evolving field, with many aspects still under investigation. To provide a basic introduction to the phenomenon, this script demonstrates how to calculate the reflectivity spectrum using the transfer matrix method (TMM). The multilayer structure consists of alternating layers of SiOâ‚‚ and Taâ‚‚Oâ‚…, with a 40 nm silver (Ag) film at the interface with the DBR, enabling the emergence of Tamm plasmon states

## Output

The simulation (DBR_competition.m) illustrates the photonic bandgap of the DBR, highlighting the spectral range where the structure behaves as a near-perfect reflector. The second code (Tamm_resonance_competition.m) reveals the presence of a Tamm plasmon resonanceâ€”observed as a sharp dip in reflectivity at the center of the photonic bandgap under normal incidence of TM-polarized light. Optical Tamm plasmon resonances (also known as Tamm plasmon-polaritons) are unique optical surface states that arise at the interface between Ag and DBR. They are the photonic counterparts of electronic Tamm states, which appear at the surface of a truncated periodic potential in solid-state physics. These resonances have promising applications in optical sensing, lasing, filtering, and high-performance mirrors.
